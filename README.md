# DynamicRipples
Dynamic ripple rendering and water surface compositing for Unity 3D

This fork is pretty much the same as the original but uses command buffers instead of second camera.

It's a basic implementation where you need to specify the particle systems that generate ripples in a list. It still needs a dynamic list and something to manage multiple water systems or large oceans.
